# Coursera-Machine-Learning

TO THE GRADERS:
(1) To view the HTML raw code: click & open the .html file
(2) To view the HTML as a webpage: open the .pdf file (I didn't know how else to view the html so I printed the .html to a .pdf)
(3) I tried to suppress messages using suppressMessages() but that did not work! Since it took over an hour to knit to html, I do not have the time to figure out why suppressMessages() does not work so please ignore the messages if grading the project for length.
